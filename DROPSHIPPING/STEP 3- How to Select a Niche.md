*How do you know which niche to target? How narrow or broad should your niche be? Should you start with only one product or build a massive store overnight?* 

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">KEEP IN MIND </mark>
-  Stick with what you know  
- Pick a niche you are **passionate** about  
- Pick a niche with big ticket items (Consumers pay more)
- The pricing and volume of consumer need/want drives most of the sales here and your passion or knowledge might be less important. 
- Get data from tools that track trends, 

How narrow or broad should your niche be? 
- Narrow focus: easy short term success, easier to manage than a wide focus, can be difficult in expanding products 
- Single product or a few product stores: Good for short term sales but cant create brand
